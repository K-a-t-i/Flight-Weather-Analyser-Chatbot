## üå¶Ô∏è Overview

This chatbot application provides weather information for locations
worldwide, including historical data, current conditions, and forecasts for up to 6
days in the future. It also features a rudimentary flight weather analysis system that
can determine an appropriate day for flying activities based on meteorological factors.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Weather Information**: Retrieve weather data for locations and dates
  - Historical weather data for past dates
  - Current weather conditions
  - Weather forecasts for up to 6 days in the future

- **Flight Weather Analysis**: Analyse and identify suitable flying days
  - Scoring system based on a few weather parameters
  - Breakdown of favorable and challenging conditions
  - Day-by-day comparison of flying conditions

- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language processing for query interpretation
  - Extract location and date information from user queries
  - Defaults for missing information

- **Robust API Handling**: Enhanced reliability and performance
  - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff for API failures
  - Response caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
  - Detailed logging of all operations

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenAI API key
- MeteoblueAPI key
- OpencageAPI key
- VisualCrossing API key
- Internet connection

## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-chatbot.git
   cd weather-chatbot
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üîë Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
METEOBLUE_API_KEY=your_meteoblue_api_key
OPENCAGE_API_KEY=your_opencage_api_key
VISUALCROSSING_API_KEY=your_visualcrossing_api_key
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python weather_chatbot.py
```

### Example Commands

- General query:
  ```
  What should I eat for lunch today?
  ```

- General weather query:
  ```
  What's the weather like in Berlin tomorrow?
  ```

- Historical weather query:
  ```
  How was the weather in Paris last Monday?
  ```

- Optimal flying day query:
  ```
  What's the best day to fly in Munich this week?
  ```

## üîå API Integrations

The application integrates with the following external APIs:

- **OpenAI**: Used for natural language understanding and query interpretation
- **Meteoblue**: Provides detailed weather forecast data for future dates
- **Opencage**: Converts location names to geographic coordinates
- **VisualCrossing**: Provides historical weather data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Weather Analysis Engine

The weather analysis engine processes meteorological data from sources to provide information including:

- Temperature (¬∞C)
- Wind speed (km/h, knots) and direction
- Precipitation and snowfall (mm)
- Relative humidity (%)
- Barometric pressure (hPa)
- Cloud cover (%)
- Special conditions (fog, mist)

## ‚úàÔ∏è Flying Conditions Analysis

The application uses a scoring system to evaluate flying conditions:

### Scoring Factors

- **Temperature**: Ideal range is 10-25¬∞C
- **Wind**: Optimal is below 15 km/h
- **Precipitation**: Ideally none
- **Snow**: Any snow is detrimental for flying
- **Cloud Cover**: Clearer skies are better
- **Humidity**: Lower is better for visibility
- **Pressure**: Stable high pressure is optimal

Each factor contributes to a base score of 100, with bonuses for favorable conditions and penalties for challenging ones.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- `weather_chatbot.py`: Main script containing the chatbot logic
- `.env`: File containing environment variables (API keys)
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## ‚ö° Limitations

- The chatbot can only provide weather forecasts for up to 6 days in the future.
- Historical weather data availability may vary depending on the location and date requested.
- Weather prediction accuracy decreases the further into the future the forecast is made.
- The analysis of flight conditions is based on the principles of general aviation but is NOT suitable for real flight activities.
- API rate limits may affect the application's performance during heavy usage.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all API keys in the `.env` file are correctly set and valid.
2. Check your internet connection.
3. Verify that all required packages are installed correctly.
4. Make sure the `.env` file is in the same directory as the `weather_chatbot.py` script.
