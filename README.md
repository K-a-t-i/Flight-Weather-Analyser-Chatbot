   cd weather-chatbot
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üîë Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
METEOBLUE_API_KEY=your_meteoblue_api_key
OPENCAGE_API_KEY=your_opencage_api_key

CACHE_DIRECTORY=cache
MAX_RETRIES=3
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the application:

```bash
python weather_chatbot.py
```

### Example Commands

- General query:
  ```
  What should I eat for lunch today?
  ```

- General weather query:
  ```
  What's the weather like in Berlin tomorrow?
  ```

- Historical weather query:
  ```
  How was the weather in Paris last Monday?
  ```

- Optimal flying day query:
  ```
  What's the best day to fly in Munich this week?
  ```

## üîå API Integrations

The application integrates with the following external APIs:

- **OpenAI**: Used for natural language understanding and query interpretation
- **Meteoblue**: Provides detailed weather forecast data for future dates
- **Opencage**: Converts location names to geographic coordinates
- **VisualCrossing**: Provides historical weather data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Weather Analysis Engine

The weather analysis engine processes meteorological data from sources to provide information including:

- Temperature (¬∞C)
- Wind speed (km/h, knots) and direction
- Precipitation and snowfall (mm)
- Relative humidity (%)
- Barometric pressure (hPa)
- Cloud cover (%)
- Special conditions (fog, mist)

## ‚úàÔ∏è Flying Conditions Analysis

The application uses a scoring system to evaluate flying conditions:

### Scoring Factors

- **Temperature**: Ideal range is 10-25¬∞C
- **Wind**: Optimal is below 15 km/h
- **Precipitation**: Ideally none
- **Snow**: Any snow is detrimental for flying
- **Cloud Cover**: Clearer skies are better
- **Humidity**: Lower is better for visibility
- **Pressure**: Stable high pressure is optimal

Each factor contributes to a base score of 100, with bonuses for favorable conditions and penalties for challenging ones.

## üîß Extended Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables or by modifying the Config class:

```python
# Default configuration values
DEFAULT_LOCATION = "Berlin"  # Default location when none specified
CACHE_ENABLED = True         # Enable/disable API response caching
CACHE_DIRECTORY = "cache"    # Directory to store cached responses
MAX_RETRIES = 3              # Maximum number of retry attempts for API requests
BASE_RETRY_DELAY = 1.0       # Base delay in seconds for retry backoff
MAX_RETRY_DELAY = 10.0       # Maximum delay in seconds for retry backoff
```

You can override these values in your `.env` file or by passing parameters to the WeatherService constructor.

## üíæ Caching System

The application implements a robust caching system to reduce API calls, improve performance, and handle rate limiting gracefully.

### Cache Configuration

The caching system can be configured through the following parameters:

```python
cache_config = {
    'enabled': True,                    # Enable or disable caching
    'directory': 'cache',               # Directory to store cache files
    'ttl': {                            # Time-to-live in seconds for different cache types
        'coordinates': 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,  # 30 days for location coordinates
        'weather': 60 * 60,                # 1 hour for weather forecasts
        'historical': 60 * 60 * 24 * 365   # 1 year for historical weather
    },
    'max_retries': 3,                   # Maximum number of retry attempts
    'base_retry_delay': 1.0,            # Base delay for exponential backoff
    'max_retry_delay': 10.0             # Maximum delay for any retry attempt
}
```

### Cache Behavior

- **Cache Key Generation**: Unique keys are generated based on the API endpoint URL, parameters, and API type.
- **Cache Invalidation**: Cached responses expire based on the TTL settings above.
- **Cache Storage**: Responses are stored as JSON files in the specified cache directory.

### Managing the Cache

- To clear the cache, delete the files in the cache directory: `rm -rf cache/*`
- To disable caching temporarily, set `CACHE_ENABLED=False` in your `.env` file
- To adjust cache duration, modify the TTL values in the Config class

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- `weather_chatbot.py`: Main script containing the chatbot logic
- `weather_service.py`: Service class for weather-related functionality
- `config.py`: Configuration management and singleton pattern implementation
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for API requests, date parsing, and caching
- `.env`: File containing environment variables (API keys)
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files to exclude from version control

## ‚ö° Limitations

- The chatbot can only provide weather forecasts for up to 6 days in the future due to API limitations.
- Historical weather data availability may vary depending on the location and date requested, with some remote locations having limited or no data.
- Weather prediction accuracy decreases the further into the future the forecast is made, with days 5-6 being significantly less reliable.
- The flying conditions analysis is based on general aviation principles but is NOT suitable for real flight activities or flight planning.
- API rate limits may affect the application's performance:
  - OpenAI: Typically limited to 3-20 requests per minute depending on your plan
  - Meteoblue: Limited to 500-2500 calls per day depending on your subscription
  - OpenCage: Typically 2500 requests per day on the free plan
  - VisualCrossing: Usually 1000 records per day on the free plan
- The caching system helps mitigate rate limits but cannot completely prevent them during heavy usage.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure all API keys in the `.env` file are correctly set and valid.
2. Check your internet connection.
3. Verify that all required packages are installed correctly.
4. Make sure the `.env` file is in the same directory as the `weather_chatbot.py` script.

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### API-Related Issues

- **Rate Limiting Errors**: If you see "I'm currently experiencing high demand" messages, you may have exceeded API rate limits:
  - Wait a few minutes before trying again
  - Check your API usage dashboard for the relevant service
  - Consider upgrading your API plan if you regularly hit limits

- **Authentication Errors**: If you see "I'm having trouble with my authentication system":
  - Verify your API keys in the `.env` file
  - Ensure the keys have not expired
  - Check if your subscription is active

- **Connection Issues**: If you see "I'm having trouble connecting to my knowledge system":
  - Check your internet connection
  - Verify that the API services are operational
  - Try again after a few minutes

#### Caching Issues

- **Cache Not Working**: If API calls are not being cached:
  - Verify that `CACHE_ENABLED=True` in your `.env` file
  - Ensure the cache directory exists and is writable
  - Check the application logs for cache-related errors

- **Outdated Cache Results**: If you're getting outdated information:
  - Clear the cache directory manually
  - Adjust the TTL settings in the configuration
  - Disable caching temporarily with `CACHE_ENABLED=False`

#### Location and Date Issues

- **Location Not Found**: If the chatbot cannot find your location:
  - Try using a more well-known location or a larger nearby city
  - Ensure the location name is spelled correctly
  - Check if OpenCage supports geocoding for that region

- **Date Parsing Errors**: If you see date-related error messages:
  - Use standard date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - Try relative dates like "tomorrow" or "next Monday"
  - Avoid ambiguous date references
